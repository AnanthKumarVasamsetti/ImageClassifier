# Image classifier
This is an image classifier to identify objects present in a given picture. Currently it is able to identify dogs and cats in a given picture.

## Getting started
This classifier in built using convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to identify whether the animal in the given picture is a **Dog** (or) a **Cat**. 
The architecture of the CNN is a built using conventional alogrithms like **ReLu** and **Softmax**
It is designed in a such a way so that regardless of the resolution and visibility it can be able to identify the animal correctly

**Dataset length:** 25,000 images for both the classes combined
**Training accuracy:** 98% (rounded)
**Testing accuracy:** 84% (rounded)

### WebFrameworks used:
The whole application is built using ***Flask*** and frameworks like ***bootstrap*** and ***ajax***

### ML libraries used:
The classifier is built using ***Tensorflow***, ***keras***, ***NumPy*** and ***Theano***
